# Boston_housing
The dataset that I made use of here, is "Boston" dataset. This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases. It has two prototasks: nox, in which the nitrous oxide level is to be predicted; and price, in which the median value of a home is to be predicted.  In this problem, I tried to predict the rate of the house if it has some particular attributes.
